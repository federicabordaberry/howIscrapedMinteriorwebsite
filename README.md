How did I do it?
Here´s the code for what I did to scrape the Uruguayan Ministry of Interior´s website
It was done with Google Sheets and R Studio Cloud
I worked mainly with scrapers, regex and spreadsheet cleaning
Most of my base code was produced by ChatGPT, meaning that it didn't always work and often I had to edit it myself, but it was an excellent and time saving structure to work from
Any questions, drop me a message in social media and I'll see if I can answer
